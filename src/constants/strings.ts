  FAQ: [
    {
      Q: "What are the benefits of ceramic tint?",
      A: "Ceramic film is superior to the alternatives. It is better than dyed film because it blocks far more heat, doesn’t fade over time, and still looks clear and rich in color; it’s better than metallic film because it offers the same or greater heat rejection without interfering with GPS, radio, or phone signals.",
    },
    {
      Q: "What is the legal tint limit in Manitoba?",
      A: "By law in Manitoba, the front side windows must allow at least 50% of light through, while there are no restrictions on the rear windows or back windshield. A 25% strip (up to 127 mm or 5 inches) is permitted at the top of the windshield. At MY Detailing, we always inform our clients of the legal standards, but ultimately, the shade you choose is up to you.",
    },
    {
      Q: "How long will my tint last?",
      A: "Llumar Ceramic Tint is built to last. With proper care, it can perform beautifully for 10 years or more. It won’t fade, bubble, or peel over time. And if anything ever does go wrong, we’ve got you covered with a lifetime warranty.",
    },
    {
      Q: "Do you offer a warranty?",
      A: "Yes! All our Llumar Ceramic films come with a lifetime manufacturer warranty against fading, bubbling, and peeling, giving you long-term confidence in your investment.",
    },
    {
      Q: "Can I roll my windows down right after tinting?",
      A: "We recommend waiting 3 to 5 days before rolling your windows down. This allows the film to fully cure and ensures a strong bond.",
